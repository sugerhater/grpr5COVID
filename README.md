# grpr5COVID - COVID-19 Statistics
Application that allows a user to see most recent COVID-19 stats for both a specific state and the 5 highest reported countries. Recent data is pulled from 2 API's and neatly placed together in a mobile-friendly interface. The user chooses the state or US territory from a dropdown list then info is populated. If a user has previously chosen a state, then when they return to the page, the previously searched info will show. The date shown in the details section is the last update of data from the chosen state recorded by the API and displayed by the application.

* State

 Using jQuery, CSS, Bulma, and HTML along with the Moment.js time library, we was able to create an application that is dynamic as one enters the city desired. API calls are made to covidtracking.com and Coronavirus Government Response Tracker for up to date info. The HTML has been validated at https://html5.validator.nu/ to be fully compliant with the HTML5 standard.
